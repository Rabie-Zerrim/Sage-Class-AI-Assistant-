- `"Add student named John, age 15, visual learner"`
- `"Register a new student called Sarah who is 16 and an auditory learner"`
- `"Create student: Emma, 14 years old, kinesthetic, grade 9"`

### ✅ These all work for Wikipedia:
- `"What is photosynthesis?"`
- `"Tell me about the solar system"`
- `"Explain how photosynthesis works"`
- `"Define mitochondria"`

### ✅ These all work for statistics:
- `"Student statistics"`
- `"How many students do we have?"`
